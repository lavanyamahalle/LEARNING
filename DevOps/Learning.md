Here‚Äôs your **detailed and beginner-friendly explanation** of **Version Control System (VCS)** concepts using **Git** ‚Äî tailored for **DevOps interview preparation**:

---

## üîπ 3. Version Control System (Git in DevOps)

---
### Git is an essential skill for DevOps. You need to know how to manage branches, push/pull code, resolve conflicts, and work with platforms like GitHub. Understanding workflows ensures smooth collaboration and reliable code delivery in CI/CD pipelines.

### üîÅ **Git init, add, commit, push, pull**

Git is a **version control system** that helps **track changes in code**, collaborate with teams, and roll back if needed.

| Command                   | What it Does                                   |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `git init`                | Initializes a new Git repository               |
| `git add file.txt`        | Stages changes to a file                       |
| `git commit -m "message"` | Saves a snapshot with a message                |
| `git push`                | Uploads commits to a remote repo (e.g. GitHub) |
| `git pull`                | Fetches and merges latest changes from remote  |

üîß Example:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
```

---

### üåø **Branching, Merging, Rebasing**

Branching helps work on features **independently** without affecting main code.

* `git branch new-feature` ‚Äì Create a branch
* `git checkout new-feature` ‚Äì Switch to it

#### ‚úÖ Merging:

Combines two branches.

```bash
git checkout main
git merge new-feature
```

#### ‚úÖ Rebasing:

Rewrites history to apply changes on top of another branch.

```bash
git rebase main
```

üî∏ Use **merge** when collaborating; **rebase** to keep a clean history.

---

### ‚öîÔ∏è **Conflict Resolution**

Occurs when two people edit the **same part of a file** differently.

**Steps to resolve:**

1. Git shows the conflict area.
2. You **edit the file manually** to keep the correct version.
3. Stage and commit the resolved file.

```bash
<<<<<<< HEAD
  Your code
=======
  Their code
>>>>>>> branch-name
```

Then:

```bash
git add conflict_file.txt
git commit -m "Resolved conflict"
```

üìå Knowing how to resolve conflicts is key for teamwork.

---

### üîÑ **Git Workflows (Git Flow, Trunk-based)**

#### ‚úÖ Git Flow:

* Structured and best for big teams.
* Uses multiple branches:

  * `main` (stable release)
  * `develop` (active dev)
  * `feature/`, `release/`, `hotfix/` branches

#### ‚úÖ Trunk-Based:

* Simple and fast
* All developers push to `main` or a short-lived branch
* Ideal for **CI/CD and Agile DevOps**

**Why it matters:**
Workflows define **how code is written, tested, and merged** in teams.

---

### üåê **Web UI: GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket (PRs, Issues)**

These platforms host Git repositories **online** and provide tools for collaboration.

#### Key Features:

| Feature             | Description                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Pull Requests (PRs) | Request to merge code, with review |
| Issues              | Bug reports or feature requests    |
| Actions/Pipelines   | Run CI/CD (build, test, deploy)    |
| Fork & Clone        | Copy projects to your account      |

üîß Example flow:

1. Create branch ‚Üí Code changes
2. Push to GitHub ‚Üí Open PR
3. Review ‚Üí Merge to main

**Why it matters:**
DevOps teams use platforms like GitHub to manage code, track bugs, and automate deployment.
