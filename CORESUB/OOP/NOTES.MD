 **History of Programming Languages** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** 

---

## 🕰️ 1. **History of Programming Languages**

### 🔹 a. **Machine Language (1st Generation)**

* Uses only **binary (0s and 1s)**
* Specific to a CPU architecture (non-portable)
* Direct hardware-level instructions

**Problems:**

* Prone to error
* Hard to debug
* Not scalable
* Tedious to write long programs

**Example:**

```
10110000 01100001  →  Move 97 into AL register (x86)
```

---

### 🔹 b. **Assembly Language (2nd Generation)**

* Uses mnemonics (like `MOV`, `ADD`, `SUB`)
* One-to-one mapping with machine instructions
* Slightly more readable

**Problems:**

* Still low-level and architecture-specific
* Prone to human error
* Difficult to manage large programs

**Example:**

```asm
MOV AL, 61h
```

---

### 🔹 c. **Procedural Programming (3rd Generation)**

* Introduced **functions**, **loops**, **blocks**, **control structures**
* Linear execution of instructions
* Code reuse through **functions**

**Popular Languages**: C, Pascal, Fortran

**Limitation**:

* Not suitable for large-scale enterprise systems
* Functions and data are separated
* Hard to model real-world entities with shared behaviors and ownership

**Example** (C):

```c
int speed = 0;
void accelerate() { speed += 10; }
```

---

## 🚘 2. **Why Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**

Procedural programming fails when:

* Many entities interact (e.g., Owner owns Car)
* Code becomes hard to **maintain and extend**
* Lack of **modularity, reusability**, and **data hiding**

OOP helps model **real-world entities as objects**, making the system:

* **Scalable**
* **Modular**
* **Reusable**
* **Secure**

---

## 🎯 3. **Real-World Object Modeling in OOP**

### 🔸 **Object**:

Anything that has:

* **Characteristics (Data/Properties)** → `engine`, `model`, `brand`
* **Behaviors (Functions/Methods)** → `start()`, `stop()`, `brake()`

### 🔸 **Class**:

Blueprint of an object.

**Example:**

```cpp
class Car {
  private:
    string model;
    int speed;

  public:
    void start() { ... }
    void stop() { ... }
};
```

---

### ⚠️ Problem in Procedural Model:

Suppose:

* `Owner` owns a `Car`
* Both are real-world objects

In procedural style:

* You use **variables** for car properties
* You use **functions** separately for both entities
* Managing these relationships gets very complex

➡️ That’s where **OOP shines** — it allows objects (like `Owner`, `Car`) to interact naturally.

---

## 🏛️ 4. **Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

### 🧩 a. **Abstraction**

* Showing **only essential details**, hiding complexity
* Focus on **what the object does**, not how it does it

**Real-world Example**:
A driver just needs to know how to **start()**, **accelerate()**, **brake()** — not how the engine works.

**Code:**

```java
car.start();   // We don’t know internal combustion logic, just the interface
```

---

### 🧱 b. **Encapsulation**

* Bundling **data and behavior** in a **single unit** (class)
* Using **access modifiers** to protect data

**Access Modifiers**:

| Modifier    | Accessible Within | Inherited Classes | Outside Class |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| `public`    | ✅                 | ✅                 | ✅             |
| `protected` | ✅                 | ✅                 | ❌             |
| `private`   | ✅                 | ❌                 | ❌             |

**Security Example:**

```cpp
class BankAccount {
  private:
    int balance;

  public:
    void deposit(int amount) {
        if (amount > 0) balance += amount;
    }
    int getBalance() { return balance; }
};
```

➡️ Even though balance is private, it can be accessed through controlled methods (getters/setters).

---

### 👪 c. **Inheritance**

* One class inherits from another
* Promotes **code reuse** and **hierarchical relationships**

**Real-world Example**:

```txt
Vehicle (Parent)
 ├── ManualCar (Child)
 └── ElectricCar (Child)
```

Both cars share `brand`, `start()`, but have specific behaviors too.

**Code:**

```java
class Car {
  void start() { ... }
}

class ElectricCar extends Car {
  void chargeBattery() { ... }
}
```

---

### 🌀 d. **Polymorphism**

* One interface, many implementations
* Behavior changes based on context

📌 **Types**:

| Type        | Description                       | Example                     |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Static**  | Compile-time (Method Overloading) | `run()`, `run(int speed)`   |
| **Dynamic** | Runtime (Method Overriding)       | `Tiger.run()`, `Duck.run()` |

**Dynamic Polymorphism Example:**

```java
class Animal {
  void run() { ... }
}
class Tiger extends Animal {
  void run() { System.out.println("Fast run"); }
}
```

**Static Polymorphism Example:**

```java
class Car {
  void accelerate() { ... }
  void accelerate(int speed) { ... }
}
```

### ✅ 1. What is OOPS?

* **Definition**: OOPS stands for **Object-Oriented Programming System**.
* **Explanation**: It is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to design applications and programs.
* **Real-World Example**: Think of a car (object) with properties like color and speed and methods like drive or brake.
* **Interview Answer**:

  > OOPS is a methodology where software design is organized around objects rather than actions and logic. Each object is an instance of a class and represents a real-world entity, encapsulating both data and behavior.

---

### ✅ 2. Basic Concepts of OOPS

* **Four Pillars**:

  1. **Abstraction**
  2. **Encapsulation**
  3. **Inheritance**
  4. **Polymorphism**
* **Interview Answer**:

  > These pillars help in designing scalable, maintainable, and modular software. Abstraction hides complexity, encapsulation binds data with code, inheritance promotes reuse, and polymorphism enables dynamic behavior.

---

### ✅ 3. What is a Class?

* **Definition**: Blueprint of an object.
* **Explanation**: Contains definitions for attributes and methods.
* **Example**:

  ```cpp
  class Car {
     public:
       string color;
       void drive();
  };
  ```
* **Interview Answer**:

  > A class is a user-defined data type that represents the blueprint for objects. It encapsulates data and behavior in one place.

---

### ✅ 4. What is an Object?

* **Definition**: Instance of a class.
* **Explanation**: Real implementation of the blueprint.
* **Example**:

  ```cpp
  Car myCar;
  ```
* **Interview Answer**:

  > An object holds its own state, behavior, and identity. It's created from a class and uses the properties defined in the class.

---

### ✅ 5. What is Encapsulation?

* **Definition**: Wrapping data and code together.
* **Detailed Explanation**:

  > It protects data by restricting access using access modifiers like `private`, `public`, `protected`.
* **Example**:

  ```java
  private int age;
  public void setAge(int a) { age = a; }
  ```
* **Interview Answer**:

  > Encapsulation ensures that sensitive data is hidden from the outside world. It provides security and improves code maintainability.

---

### ✅ 6. What is Polymorphism?

* **Definition**: Ability to take many forms.
* **Types**: Compile-time (overloading), Runtime (overriding)
* **Example**:

  ```java
  void draw() {...}
  void draw(int radius) {...} // Overloaded
  ```
* **Interview Answer**:

  > Polymorphism enables the same function to behave differently based on the input. It promotes code flexibility and reusability.

---

### ✅ 7. What is Inheritance?

* **Definition**: Acquiring properties from parent class.
* **Types**:

  * Single
  * Multiple
  * Multilevel
  * Hierarchical
  * Hybrid
* **Example**:

  ```java
  class Animal {}
  class Dog extends Animal {}
  ```
* **Interview Answer**:

  > Inheritance promotes code reuse. The child class inherits data and methods from the parent, avoiding code duplication.

---

### ✅ 8. What are Manipulators?

* **Definition**: Functions used with I/O stream.
* **Example**: `endl`, `setw` in C++.
* **Interview Answer**:

  > Manipulators format the output stream in C++ to control layout and precision, improving readability.

---

### ✅ 9. What is a Constructor?

* **Definition**: Special method to initialize objects.
* **Rules**:

  * Same name as class
  * No return type
* **Example**:

  ```cpp
  class Car {
    Car() { cout << "Created"; }
  };
  ```
* **Interview Answer**:

  > Constructors ensure that every object starts in a valid state. They are automatically called during object creation.

---

### ✅ 10. What is a Destructor?

* **Definition**: Cleans up resources.
* **Syntax**: `~ClassName()`
* **Interview Answer**:

  > Destructors release memory or file handles when an object goes out of scope, avoiding resource leakage.




---

### ✅ 11. What is an Inline Function?

* **Definition**: A function where the compiler replaces the function call with the actual function code.
* **Detailed Explanation**:

  > Inline functions reduce the overhead of function calls, especially for small, frequently called functions. The compiler inserts the complete code of the function wherever it’s called, saving the time of jumping to the function definition.
* **Syntax**:

  ```cpp
  inline int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
  }
  ```
* **Interview Answer**:

  > Inline functions are a performance optimization feature in C++. They're used to avoid the overhead of function calls by embedding the function code directly at the point of use. However, overusing them can increase the size of the binary (code bloat).

---

### ✅ 12. What is a Virtual Function?

* **Definition**: A member function that is overridden in a derived class.
* **Detailed Explanation**:

  > Declared using the `virtual` keyword in base class. Enables **runtime polymorphism**. The actual function that gets called is determined at **runtime** using **vtable** (virtual table).
* **Syntax**:

  ```cpp
  class Base {
    public:
      virtual void show() { cout << "Base"; }
  };
  class Derived : public Base {
    public:
      void show() override { cout << "Derived"; }
  };
  ```
* **Interview Answer**:

  > A virtual function supports late binding. It allows child classes to override base class methods and ensures that the correct method is called for an object, even if it’s referenced via a base class pointer.

---

### ✅ 13. What is a Friend Function?

* **Definition**: A function that is not a member but has access to private and protected members.
* **Detailed Explanation**:

  > Declared using the `friend` keyword inside the class. Useful for operator overloading or when two or more classes need to share information.
* **Syntax**:

  ```cpp
  class Box {
    friend void printVolume(Box b);
  };
  ```
* **Interview Answer**:

  > A friend function breaks encapsulation but is useful when two classes need to collaborate closely. It's often used in operator overloading scenarios where access to private members is needed.

---

### ✅ 14. What is Function Overloading?

* **Definition**: Multiple functions with the same name but different parameters.
* **Detailed Explanation**:

  > Differentiation is based on the number or type of arguments. It's an example of **compile-time polymorphism**.
* **Example**:

  ```cpp
  void display(int a);
  void display(double b);
  ```
* **Interview Answer**:

  > Function overloading enhances code readability and reusability. The compiler determines which function to call based on the argument types at compile time.

---

### ✅ 15. What is Operator Overloading?

* **Definition**: Changing the behavior of an operator for user-defined types.
* **Detailed Explanation**:

  > Makes code intuitive and readable. Overloaded operators are implemented using functions.
* **Example**:

  ```cpp
  class Complex {
    Complex operator+(Complex c);
  };
  ```
* **Interview Answer**:

  > Operator overloading allows user-defined types (classes) to behave like primitive types with respect to operators like `+`, `-`, etc., improving the expressiveness of your code.

---

### ✅ 16. What is an Abstract Class?

* **Definition**: A class that contains at least one pure virtual function.
* **Detailed Explanation**:

  > Cannot be instantiated. Meant to be inherited. Used to define **interfaces** or **base templates** for derived classes.
* **Syntax**:

  ```cpp
  class Shape {
    virtual void draw() = 0;
  };
  ```
* **Interview Answer**:

  > Abstract classes provide a way to enforce certain methods in derived classes. They're foundational for implementing polymorphism and interfaces in object-oriented design.

---

### ✅ 17. What is the Ternary Operator?

* **Definition**: A conditional operator that takes three operands.
* **Syntax**:

  ```cpp
  condition ? expr1 : expr2;
  ```
* **Example**:

  ```cpp
  int result = (a > b) ? a : b;
  ```
* **Interview Answer**:

  > The ternary operator is a shorthand for if-else. It improves code brevity but should be used judiciously for clarity.

---

### ✅ 18. What is the use of the `finalize()` method?

* **Definition**: A method used to perform cleanup operations before garbage collection (in Java).
* **Detailed Explanation**:

  > Defined in Java’s `Object` class. Called before the object is garbage collected. Rarely used in modern Java due to unpredictable behavior.
* **Syntax**:

  ```java
  protected void finalize() throws Throwable { ... }
  ```
* **Interview Answer**:

  > `finalize()` provides a mechanism for releasing resources, but since it's not guaranteed to execute immediately or reliably, alternatives like `try-with-resources` or `finally` blocks are preferred.

---

### ✅ 19. What are the Different Types of Arguments?

* **Definition**: Arguments define how values are passed to functions.
* **Types**:

  1. **Call by Value** – Copies the value. Changes inside function don’t affect original.
  2. **Call by Reference** – Passes reference. Changes affect original.
* **Example**:

  ```cpp
  void func(int a); // call by value
  void func(int &a); // call by reference
  ```
* **Interview Answer**:

  > Call by value is safer but less powerful, as it doesn’t affect the original variable. Call by reference is more flexible but needs careful handling to avoid bugs.

---

### ✅ 20. What is the `super` Keyword?

* **Definition**: Used to access the parent class’s members.
* **Detailed Explanation**:

  > Common in Java and other OOP languages. Helps to access overridden methods or constructors.
* **Example**:

  ```java
  class Dog extends Animal {
    Dog() {
      super(); // calls Animal constructor
    }
  }
  ```
* **Interview Answer**:

  > `super` helps in accessing the base class's methods or constructors when overridden in the subclass. It's essential for inheritance-based control flows.



---

### ✅ 21. What is Method Overriding?

* **Definition**: When a subclass redefines a method of its superclass with the same name, parameters, and return type.
* **Detailed Explanation**:

  > It is used to provide a specific implementation in the subclass that’s already defined in the parent class. Enables **runtime polymorphism**.
* **Example**:

  ```java
  class Animal {
    void sound() { System.out.println("Animal Sound"); }
  }
  class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() { System.out.println("Bark"); }
  }
  ```
* **Interview Answer**:

  > Method overriding lets a subclass provide a specialized behavior for a method already defined in the superclass. It enables dynamic method dispatch during runtime.

---

### ✅ 22. What is an Interface?

* **Definition**: A collection of abstract methods.
* **Detailed Explanation**:

  > Interfaces define **what** a class should do, not **how**. A class implementing the interface must define all methods.
* **Example**:

  ```java
  interface Animal {
    void eat();
  }
  class Dog implements Animal {
    public void eat() { System.out.println("Dog eats"); }
  }
  ```
* **Interview Answer**:

  > Interfaces provide a way to achieve full abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java. They form a contract that classes must follow, ensuring consistency and decoupling.

---

### ✅ 23. What is Exception Handling?

* **Definition**: Mechanism to handle runtime errors.
* **Detailed Explanation**:

  > Prevents program from crashing. Uses `try`, `catch`, `throw`, `throws`, and `finally` (in Java).
* **Example**:

  ```java
  try {
    int a = 5 / 0;
  } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("Divide by zero!");
  }
  ```
* **Interview Answer**:

  > Exception handling gracefully manages errors without crashing the program. It separates error-handling logic from regular code flow and improves reliability.

---

### ✅ 24. What are Tokens?

* **Definition**: The smallest meaningful elements in a program.
* **Types**:

  * Keywords
  * Identifiers
  * Constants
  * Operators
  * String literals
* **Example**:
  In `int a = 5;` → `int`, `a`, `=`, `5`, `;` are tokens.
* **Interview Answer**:

  > Tokens are the building blocks of a program. A compiler uses tokens to understand the structure and meaning of the code during lexical analysis.

---

### ✅ 25. Difference Between Overloading and Overriding

| Feature          | Overloading                  | Overriding             |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Binding          | Compile-time (early binding) | Runtime (late binding) |
| Class Scope      | Same class                   | Base & derived class   |
| Method Signature | Must differ                  | Must be identical      |
| Purpose          | Increase flexibility         | Customize behavior     |

* **Interview Answer**:

  > Overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. Overriding lets subclasses change or specialize parent class methods. One is compile-time, the other is runtime.

---

### ✅ 26. Difference Between Class and Object

| Feature    | Class                            | Object                            |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Definition | Blueprint of object              | Instance of class                 |
| Memory     | No memory allocation             | Memory allocated on instantiation |
| Use        | Defines properties and behaviors | Performs actions and holds data   |

* **Interview Answer**:

  > A class is a template; an object is a real-world instance of that class. Think of a class as a car blueprint, and an object as a real car.

---

### ✅ 27. What is Abstraction?

* **Definition**: Hiding internal implementation and showing only functionality.
* **Detailed Explanation**:

  > Used to reduce complexity and increase efficiency by exposing only relevant details. Achieved through **abstract classes** or **interfaces**.
* **Real-Life Example**:

  > A mobile phone lets you make a call without knowing the internal wiring or chip layout.
* **Interview Answer**:

  > Abstraction promotes simplicity and hides the irrelevant details from the user. It’s implemented using abstract classes and interfaces.

---

### ✅ 28. What are Access Modifiers?

* **Definition**: Keywords that set visibility of class members.
* **Types**:

  * `public` – accessible everywhere
  * `private` – accessible within the same class
  * `protected` – accessible in subclass or same package
  * `friend` – used in C++ to allow external access
  * `protected internal` – .NET concept
* **Interview Answer**:

  > Access modifiers enforce encapsulation by controlling access to class members. They are critical for code security and modularity.

---

### ✅ 29. What are Sealed Modifiers?

* **Definition**: Prevents classes from being inherited.
* **Usage**:

  > In C#, `sealed` keyword is used. Also applicable to methods and properties to prevent override.
* **Interview Answer**:

  > A sealed class ensures that the implementation cannot be changed via inheritance. It’s used to lock down behavior and improve performance by avoiding dynamic dispatch.

---

### ✅ 30. Can You Call a Base Method Without Creating an Instance?

* **Answer**: Yes, but the method must be static.
* **How**:

  * Use `ClassName.methodName()` if static.
  * Or call via `base.Method()` inside a subclass.
* **Interview Answer**:

  > Yes, static methods can be called using the class name without instantiating an object. For non-static base methods, you must call them through inheritance using `base`.

---




### ✅ 31. What is the Difference Between `new` and `override`?

| Aspect   | `new` Modifier                   | `override` Modifier                      |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Purpose  | Hides the base class method      | Overrides the base class method          |
| Behavior | Static/compile-time polymorphism | Runtime polymorphism (virtual dispatch)  |
| Relation | No relationship with base method | Must override a virtual method from base |
| Result   | Calls depend on reference type   | Calls depend on actual object type       |

* **Interview Answer**:

  > The `new` keyword hides the base class method in the derived class, while `override` replaces it entirely. Use `override` when the method in the base class is marked `virtual` and you want runtime polymorphic behavior.

---

### ✅ 32. What are the Various Types of Constructors?

1. **Default Constructor**: No parameters
2. **Parameterized Constructor**: Accepts parameters to initialize fields
3. **Copy Constructor**: Creates a copy of another object (common in C++)

* **Example (Java)**:

  ```java
  class Person {
    Person() {} // Default
    Person(String name) {} // Parameterized
    Person(Person p) {} // Copy
  }
  ```
* **Interview Answer**:

  > Constructors are used to initialize objects. The default constructor initializes fields with default values. Parameterized constructors allow customization. Copy constructors clone existing objects.

---

### ✅ 33. What is Early and Late Binding?

| Binding Type  | Early Binding      | Late Binding      |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Also Called   | Static Binding     | Dynamic Binding   |
| Decision Time | Compile-time       | Run-time          |
| Example       | Method overloading | Method overriding |

* **Interview Answer**:

  > Early binding occurs when the method to be called is known at compile-time. Late binding defers the decision to runtime, enabling polymorphism. Languages like C++ and Java support both types depending on use of `virtual`/`override`.

---

### ✅ 34. What is the `this` Pointer?

* **Definition**: A pointer referring to the current object.
* **Detailed Explanation**:

  > Used inside a class method to refer to the calling object, especially to resolve naming conflicts or pass the current object.
* **Example (C++)**:

  ```cpp
  class Box {
    int length;
    void setLength(int length) {
      this->length = length;
    }
  };
  ```
* **Interview Answer**:

  > `this` is an implicit pointer available in non-static methods, allowing access to the current object’s members and distinguishing between local and instance variables.

---

### ✅ 35. Difference Between Structure and Class?

| Feature        | Structure                | Class                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Default Access | Public                   | Private                             |
| Purpose        | Mainly for data grouping | Supports full OOP (data + behavior) |
| Inheritance    | Not supported (in C)     | Supported                           |
| Validation     | Rarely validated         | Strong encapsulation and validation |

* **Interview Answer**:

  > A `struct` is lightweight and used for grouping related data. A `class` supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. In C++, both are similar with one key difference: default access.

---

### ✅ 36. What is the Default Access Modifier in a Class?

* **Answer**:

  * In **C++**, default access for members is `private`.
  * In **C#**, a class itself defaults to `internal`.
  * In **Java**, it's **package-private** (accessible within the same package).

* **Interview Answer**:

  > The default access modifier for class members is private in C++ and Java. This promotes encapsulation by restricting access unless explicitly declared public or protected.

---

### ✅ 37. What is a Pure Virtual Function?

* **Definition**: A virtual function with no implementation.
* **Syntax (C++)**:

  ```cpp
  virtual void draw() = 0;
  ```
* **Use**: To create **abstract classes**.
* **Interview Answer**:

  > A pure virtual function acts as a placeholder that enforces derived classes to implement it. It enables abstraction and is the foundation for polymorphic behavior in C++.

---

### ✅ 38. Which Operators Cannot Be Overloaded?

* **Answer**:

  1. Scope Resolution Operator (`::`)
  2. Member Selection Operator (`.`)
  3. Member Pointer Selector (`.*`)
* **Interview Answer**:

  > These operators cannot be overloaded because they are integral to the language's internal structure or syntax. Allowing overloading could lead to ambiguous behavior or compiler confusion.

---

### ✅ 39. What is Dynamic (Runtime) Polymorphism?

* **Definition**: Behavior where a function call is resolved at runtime.
* **Achieved via**:

  * **Virtual functions** (C++)
  * **Method overriding** (Java/C#)
* **Interview Answer**:

  > Dynamic polymorphism allows the appropriate method to be selected at runtime depending on the actual object type. It improves flexibility and enables interface-based programming.

---

### ✅ 40. Do We Require a Parameter for Constructors?

* **Answer**: No. Constructors can be:

  * **Default** (no parameters)
  * **Parameterized**
* **Interview Answer**:

  > No, constructors don’t necessarily require parameters. A default constructor initializes an object with default values. However, parameterized constructors offer more control for initializing object state.

---

Here are the **final 10 OOPs Interview Questions (Q41–Q50)** with **structured and very detailed interview-ready explanations**:

---

### ✅ 41. What is a Copy Constructor?

* **Definition**: A special constructor used to create a new object as a copy of an existing object.
* **Syntax (C++)**:

  ```cpp
  class Person {
    public:
      Person(const Person &p) {
        // Copy fields from p
      }
  };
  ```
* **Behavior**:

  > Invoked when an object is:

  * Passed by value
  * Returned from a function
  * Explicitly copied
* **Interview Answer**:

  > A copy constructor creates a duplicate object using an existing one. It ensures deep copy for dynamic resources, preventing shallow copy issues like shared memory corruption.

### ✅ 42. What Does the Keyword `virtual` Represent in a Method Definition?

* **Definition**: Declares a function as overridable in derived classes.
* **Behavior**:

  > Enables **runtime polymorphism** using a **virtual table** (vtable). When called via a base class pointer or reference, it invokes the derived class’s method.
* **Interview Answer**:

  > The `virtual` keyword marks a method for dynamic dispatch. It ensures the most derived implementation is called during execution, supporting polymorphism and extensibility.

---

### ✅ 43. Can Static Methods Use Non-Static Members?

* **Answer**: ❌ No.
* **Reason**:

  > Static methods belong to the class, not an instance. They cannot access non-static members directly because those require an object context.
* **Interview Answer**:

  > Static methods can only access other static members. To access non-static data, they must receive an object reference.

### ✅ 44. What Are Base Class, Subclass, and Superclass?

| Term       | Description                                                           |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Base Class | The class that provides foundational behavior and structure           |
| Subclass   | Inherits from the base class and may override or extend functionality |
| Superclass | Synonym for base class (used often in Java)                           |

* **Example**:

  ```java
  class Animal {}  // Superclass
  class Dog extends Animal {} // Subclass
  ```
* **Interview Answer**:

  > The base (or superclass) is the general class being extended. The subclass (or derived class) inherits from the base and specializes its behavior.

### ✅ 45. What is Static and Dynamic Binding?

| Binding Type | Static Binding          | Dynamic Binding     |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| Also Called  | Early binding           | Late binding        |
| Time         | Happens at compile-time | Happens at run-time |
| Example      | Function overloading    | Method overriding   |

* **Interview Answer**:

  > Static binding means the method call is resolved during compilation. Dynamic binding resolves method calls at runtime based on object type, enabling polymorphism.

---

### ✅ 46. How Many Instances Can Be Created for an Abstract Class?

* **Answer**: ❌ **Zero**
* **Reason**:

  > Abstract classes are incomplete by design. They are meant to be inherited, and cannot be directly instantiated.
* **Interview Answer**:

  > Abstract classes can’t be instantiated because they may contain undefined (abstract) methods. Only concrete subclasses with full implementations can be instantiated.

---

### ✅ 47. Which Keyword is Used for Operator Overloading?

* **Answer**: `operator`
* **Syntax (C++)**:

  ```cpp
  Complex operator+(const Complex& c);
  ```
* **Interview Answer**:

  > The `operator` keyword is used to define custom behavior for operators when used with user-defined types. It enhances code readability and aligns user types with native types.

---

### ✅ 48. What is the Default Access Specifier in a Class Definition?

* **Answer**:

  * **In C++**: Private (for class members)
  * **In Java**: Package-private (no keyword used)
* **Interview Answer**:

  > If no access specifier is declared:

  * C++ defaults class members to `private`
  * Java defaults class access to package-level visibility

---

### ✅ 49. Which OOPS Concept is Used as a Reuse Mechanism?

* **Answer**: **Inheritance**
* **Explanation**:

  > Inheritance enables reuse of code by deriving new classes from existing ones. Child classes inherit attributes and behaviors and may add or override them.
* **Interview Answer**:

  > Inheritance promotes software reusability. Instead of rewriting code, subclasses can inherit and extend the functionality of parent classes.

---

### ✅ 50. Which OOPS Concept Exposes Only the Necessary Information to the Calling Functions?

* **Answer**: **Encapsulation**
* **Explanation**:

  > It hides internal state and exposes only what is necessary through public methods.
* **Interview Answer**:

  > Encapsulation controls access to internal class details using access modifiers. This protects data and ensures a clean, secure API for users of the class.
